# Accident Blackspot Mapping & Safe Route Identification

This project uses **Kenyas road Traffic crash data between 2012 and 2023** and **OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks** to identify and plot accident blackspots in  Kenya and to suggest **safer driving routes** that minimize exposure to high-risk road segments.

## üìå Features

**Accident Blackspot Mapping**

  * Geospatial visualization of crash locations in the country.

**Crash Data Analysis**

  * Distribution of crashes by month, hour, and day of week.
  * patterns visualized using bar plots and heatmaps.

**Safe Route Identification**

  * Assigns a **risk score** to each road segment based on crash history.
  * This aids in Computing both:

    * **Shortest Route (distance-based)**
    * **Safer Route (risk-aware, balancing crash history & distance)**
  * Routes visualized on interactive maps using **Folium**.

## Sample Outputs

* Crash counts by month & hour
* Heatmap of crash distribution (Day vs Hour)
* Folium maps showing:

  * crash hotspots
  * Safe vs shortest driving routes in Nairobi
